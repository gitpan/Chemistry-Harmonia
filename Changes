Revision history for Perl extension Chemistry::Harmonia.

0.111  2013-05-18
	- Fixed tests for new subroutine stoichiometry()

0.11  2013-05-17
	- Added new powerfull subroutine stoichiometry()
	- Added new subroutine brutto_formula()
	- Fixed a problem with the 0 for C0, H0, N0, P0 and others to-> {Co CO}, {Ho HO}...
	- Removing of points in late of the formulas
	- Added tests, examples into documentation
	- README revised
	- Refused to use the module Regexp::Common (due to a problem of unpredictable changes. Replaced it a my pure perl code)
	- High-speed optimization
	- Algorithm of OSE recognition is refined
	- Correction and optimization of sub 'good_formula'
